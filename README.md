## Installation

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

Docker provides the simplest and most reliable deployment method for PyCashFlow.

#### Pull the Latest Image

```bash
docker pull whahn1983/pycashflow:latest
```

#### Run the Container

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000 \
  -v /mnt/data:/app/app/data \
  -v /mnt/migrations:/app/migrations \
  -e TZ=America/New_York \
  -e ENABLE_CRON=true \
  -v /mnt/.env:/app/app/.env \
  --restart always \
  --pull always \
  --name pycashflow \
  whahn1983/pycashflow:latest
```

#### Volume Explanations

| Volume Mount | Purpose | Required |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| `/mnt/data:/app/app/data` | Persistent database storage | **Yes** |
| `/mnt/migrations:/app/migrations` | Database migration files | Recommended |
| `/mnt/.env:/app/app/.env` | Environment variables (.env settings, passkeys, bootstrap admin, etc.) | Optional |

#### Time Zone Configuration

Set the container's local time zone using the `TZ` environment variable:

```bash
-e TZ=America/New_York
```

If `TZ` is not provided, the container defaults to `UTC`.

#### Access the Application

Once running, access PyCashFlow at `http://localhost:5000`

#### Production WSGI Server (Gunicorn)

Containerized production startup uses Gunicorn (via `/entry.sh`) and keeps startup behavior unchanged: timezone setup, ownership fixes, optional cron startup, and `flask db upgrade` before serving requests.

#### Cron Startup Control

Use `ENABLE_CRON` to control whether container startup launches `crond`:

- `ENABLE_CRON=true` (default): start cron inside the container
- `ENABLE_CRON=false`: skip cron startup
- If unset, startup defaults to `true`

`ENABLE_CRON` can be provided either as a Docker environment variable (`-e ENABLE_CRON=...`) or in your mounted `.env` file at `/app/app/.env`.

For platforms like **DigitalOcean App Platform** where you run scheduled jobs separately, set:

```bash
-e ENABLE_CRON=false
```

Supported Gunicorn environment variables:

- `GUNICORN_WORKERS`: Number of worker processes. If unset, startup chooses:
  - `1` when `RATELIMIT_STORAGE_URI` is unset or uses `memory://` (process-local rate-limit storage)
  - otherwise `2 * CPU + 1`
- `GUNICORN_TIMEOUT`: Worker timeout seconds (default: `120`)

Example:

```bash
-e ENABLE_CRON=false \
-e GUNICORN_WORKERS=4 \
-e GUNICORN_TIMEOUT=180
```

---

---

## User Roles & Access Control

PyCashFlow implements a three-tier access control system:

### Global Administrator
- **Full System Access**: Manage all users and system settings
- **User Approval**: Activate or deactivate user accounts
- **Email Configuration**: Set up system notification emails
- **Cannot Be Deactivated**: Ensures system always has an administrator

### Account Owner
- **Full Cash Flow Management**: Create, edit, and delete schedules
- **Scenario Modeling**: Build and manage what-if scenarios for financial planning
- **Balance Management**: Manual and automated balance updates
- **Guest User Management**: Create and manage view-only users
- **Data Management**: Import/export transaction schedules
- **AI Insights**: Configure OpenAI API key, select the model version, and refresh cash flow analysis on demand

### Guest User
- **Dashboard Access Only**: View cash flow chart and current balance
- **No Editing Permissions**: Cannot modify schedules or settings
- **Requires Activation**: Must be activated by account owner before access

---

## Core Capabilities

### Cash Flow Calculation Engine

PyCashFlow's sophisticated calculation engine (`/app/cashflow.py`) provides:

- **Multi-Frequency Support**: Handles Monthly, Weekly, BiWeekly, Quarterly, Yearly, and One-Time transactions
- **Business Day Logic**: Automatically adjusts transaction dates for weekends
  - Income transactions: Rolled back to last business day
  - Expense transactions: Advanced to next business day
- **Hold Management**: Temporarily pause scheduled transactions
- **Skip Functionality**: Skip individual future instances without affecting the entire schedule
- **Running Balance Projections**: Calculate balance for every day up to 12 months ahead
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Remove past one-time transactions

### Transaction Scheduling

Create and manage recurring financial events:

- **Flexible Frequencies**: Choose from multiple recurrence patterns
- **Custom Amounts**: Set precise transaction amounts
- **Income vs Expense**: Categorize transactions for accurate projections
- **Hold Until Date**: Temporarily suspend transactions
- **Skip Future Instances**: One-time skips without schedule deletion

### Scenario Modeling

Model hypothetical "what-if" financial situations without affecting your live schedule:

- **Separate Scenario Table**: Create and manage scenarios independently from your real schedules
- **Same Frequency Support**: All six frequencies (Monthly, Weekly, BiWeekly, Quarterly, Yearly, One-Time) work identically to regular schedules, including business day adjustments
- **Dual-Line Chart**: The dashboard chart renders a solid blue line for your current schedule and a dashed amber line for schedules + scenarios, so both projections are visible simultaneously
- **Scenario Minimum Balance**: The Lowest Balance (90 days) card displays the schedule-only minimum alongside the scenario minimum in amber e.g. `$1,200 ($850)`
- **No Auto-Delete**: One-time scenarios that have passed are skipped in projection but never auto-deleted — remove them manually when no longer needed
- **Full CRUD**: Edit and delete scenarios via the Scenarios page; no holds or skips needed since scenarios are purely hypothetical

### Balance Tracking

Multiple methods for keeping your balance current:

- **Manual Entry**: Set balance for any specific date
- **Email Import**: Automatic extraction from bank notification emails
- **Historical Tracking**: View balance history over time

---

## REST API

PyCashFlow provides a RESTful JSON API under `/api/v1/` for programmatic access and mobile app integration. All API routes are CSRF-exempt and require Bearer token authentication.

### Authentication

#### Login

Obtain a bearer token by posting credentials to the login endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-server/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "s3cr3t"}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "token": "<bearer_token>",
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "is_admin": false,
      "is_global_admin": false,
      "twofa_enabled": false,
      "is_guest": false
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: Accounts with two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled cannot authenticate via the API at this time.

#### Using the Token

Include the token in the `Authorization` header on all subsequent requests:

```bash
curl https://your-server/api/v1/dashboard \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <bearer_token>"
```

Tokens are valid for **30 days**. Only the SHA-256 hash of each token is stored; the raw token is returned once at login and cannot be recovered.

#### Logout

Invalidate the current token:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-server/api/v1/auth/logout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <bearer_token>"
```

#### Current User

Retrieve the authenticated user's profile:

```
GET /api/v1/auth/me
```

### Data Endpoints

All data endpoints are read-only (`GET`) and require authentication. Guest users automatically see their account owner's data.

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/v1/dashboard` | Dashboard summary — current balance, risk score, upcoming transactions, and 90-day minimum balance |
| `GET /api/v1/balance` | Current balance snapshot (lightweight, no projection engine) |
| `GET /api/v1/schedules` | All recurring scheduled transactions |
| `GET /api/v1/transactions` | Expanded upcoming transactions for the next 90 days (with holds and skips applied) |
| `GET /api/v1/projections` | Running-balance projection data points for both schedule-only and schedule+scenario series |
| `GET /api/v1/scenarios` | All what-if scenario items |
| `GET /api/v1/holds` | All held (paused) schedule items |
| `GET /api/v1/skips` | All skipped transaction instances |
| `GET /api/v1/risk-score` | Detailed cash-flow risk assessment with full score breakdown |

### Response Format

**Success — single resource:**
```json
{ "data": { ... } }
```

**Success — collection:**
```json
{ "data": [ ... ], "meta": { "total": 5 } }
```

**Error:**
```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable message",
  "code": "machine_slug",
  "status": 401
}
```

**Validation error (422):**
```json
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "code": "validation_error",
  "status": 422,
  "fields": { "email": "Email is required" }
}
```

All monetary values are returned as **decimal strings** (e.g. `"1234.56"`) to avoid floating-point precision issues. Dates use **ISO 8601** format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).

---

## AI Insights

PyCashFlow integrates with the OpenAI API to provide on-demand cash flow analysis directly on your dashboard.

### How It Works

1. The account owner adds their OpenAI API key in **Settings → AI Insights**
2. The key is encrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption (same `APP_SECRET` used for email passwords) before being stored in the database
3. On the dashboard, click **Refresh** to trigger a live query to OpenAI
4. The AI analyzes a 90-day projection of your schedule (not scenarios) including:
   - Current balance
   - Schedule of recurring transactions (name, amount, frequency, type)
   - Lowest projected balance within 90 days
5. Results are cached in the database and displayed as color-coded insight cards
6. Guest users can view cached insights but cannot trigger a refresh

### Cash Risk Score

The Cash Risk Score is a deterministic **0–100 indicator** calculated on every page refresh from your projected cash flow data — no OpenAI API key required. It is always visible as a mandatory card at the top of the AI Insights section and as an inline badge on the Lowest Balance metric card.

#### Score Categories

| Score | Status | Color |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 80–100 | Safe | Green |
| 60–79 | Stable | Blue |
| 40–59 | Watch | Yellow |
| 20–39 | Risk | Orange |
| 0–19 | Critical | Red |

#### How the Score Is Calculated

The score is a weighted composite of four factors derived from your 90-day projection:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Cash Runway** | 40% | `current_balance ÷ avg_daily_expense` — how many days the current balance can cover expenses. ≥90 days = full score; <45 days = risky. |
| **Lowest Projected Balance** | 25% | `lowest_balance ÷ avg_monthly_expense` — how the dip compares to a typical month of spending. |
| **Days Until Lowest Balance** | 20% | How far away the projected balance dip is. ≥30 days = full score; <14 days = high risk. |
| **Volatility** | 15% | `(max_balance − min_balance) ÷ current_balance` — large balance swings increase risk. |

Each factor is scored 0–100 individually, then combined into the final weighted score.

#### What Is Displayed

The mandatory cash risk card always shows:
- The numeric score and status badge in the appropriate status color
- Cash runway in days
- Days until the lowest projected balance, and the projected low amount

When an OpenAI API key is configured and insights are refreshed, the AI also generates a **Cash Risk** explanation insight as its first entry, describing the primary factors behind the score in plain language.

### Insight Types

| Type | Color | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Cash Risk** | Indigo | Always-present AI explanation of the cash risk score and its key drivers |
| **Risk** | Red | Potential cash flow shortfalls or timing problems |
| **Pattern** | Blue | Recurring patterns in your transaction schedule |
| **Observation** | Green | General financial observations about your projection |

### Configuration

1. Obtain an API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings → AI Insights → Configure API Key**
3. Enter your `sk-...` key and save
4. Optionally enter an **OpenAI Model** name (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`). Leave the field blank to use the default model (`gpt-4o-mini`)
5. Return to the dashboard and click **Refresh** to generate your first analysis

> **Note**: AI queries are only made when you click Refresh, keeping costs minimal. The last-updated timestamp on the card shows how stale the cached results are.

---

## Payments & Activation

PyCashFlow supports optional subscription enforcement for hosted deployments while remaining friendly to self-hosted installations.

### Runtime Toggle

- `PAYMENTS_ENABLED=true`: Enforces subscription checks for authenticated **non-global-admin** users
- `PAYMENTS_ENABLED=false`: Bypasses subscription checks (recommended default for self-hosted/manual operation)

### Subscription Truth Sources

When payment enforcement is enabled, activation state is driven server-side from:

- Stripe webhook events at `POST /api/v1/billing/webhook/stripe`
- App Store verification at `POST /api/v1/billing/verify-appstore`

Client-side purchase state is **not** trusted as an activation source.

### Password Setup for Payment-Created Users

For users created from payment flows (Stripe/App Store), PyCashFlow sends a one-time password setup link instead of assigning a plaintext password. This flow depends on:

- `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` (required): Base URL used to build setup links
- `PASSWORD_SETUP_TOKEN_TTL_MINUTES` (optional): Link expiration window

Setup links are generated on the fixed frontend route: `/auth/set-password/<token>`.

---

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

PyCashFlow supports TOTP-based two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security to your account.

### Enabling 2FA

1. Log in and navigate to **Settings → Two-Factor Authentication**
2. Click **Enable 2FA**
3. Scan the displayed QR code with your authenticator app:
   - Google Authenticator
   - Authy
   - Microsoft Authenticator
   - 1Password
   - Bitwarden
   - Any other TOTP-compatible app
4. If you can't scan the QR code, enter the secret key manually into your app
5. Enter the 6-digit code shown in your authenticator app to confirm setup
6. **Save your backup codes** — they are displayed once immediately after activation

### Logging In with 2FA

After entering your email and password, you will be prompted for your 6-digit TOTP code. Open your authenticator app and enter the current code to complete login.

### Backup Codes

When you enable 2FA, PyCashFlow generates **10 single-use backup codes**. Store these in a safe place. If you lose access to your authenticator app, you can use a backup code in place of the TOTP code to log in. Each backup code can only be used once.

### Disabling 2FA

1. Navigate to **Settings → Two-Factor Authentication**
2. Click **Disable 2FA**
3. Confirm with your account password and a current TOTP code (or a backup code)

### Security Details

- TOTP secrets are encrypted at rest using Fernet symmetric encryption (derived from `APP_SECRET`)
- Backup codes are hashed with scrypt before storage and consumed on first use
- A ±30-second clock skew tolerance is applied to TOTP verification
- The 2FA verification endpoint is rate-limited to prevent brute-force attacks

---

## Email Integration

### Automated Balance Updates

PyCashFlow can automatically update your account balance by reading bank notification emails.

#### Configuration Steps

1. Navigate to **Settings → Email Configuration**
2. Enter your email credentials:
   - IMAP server address
   - Email address
   - Password (stored securely)
3. Configure search parameters:
   - Email subject to search for (e.g., "Balance Alert")
   - Balance start delimiter (text before balance)
   - Balance end delimiter (text after balance)
4. Save configuration

#### How It Works

- Cron job runs every minute (Docker) or as configured (manual installation)
- Searches for emails from the past 24 hours matching your subject
- Extracts balance using your configured delimiters
- Updates your account balance automatically
- Processes all users independently (one failure doesn't affect others)

### System Notifications

PyCashFlow sends email notifications for:

- **New User Registrations**: Alerts global admin when someone signs up
- **Account Activation**: Notifies user when their account is approved

---

## Data Management

### Export Schedules

Export your transaction schedules to CSV format:

1. Navigate to **Schedule → Export**
2. Download CSV file with all scheduled transactions
3. Use for backup, analysis, or migration

### Import Schedules

Import schedules from CSV files:

1. Prepare CSV file with columns: `name`, `amount`, `frequency`, `type`, `day`
2. Navigate to **Schedule → Import**
3. Select CSV file and upload
4. Existing schedules are preserved; new entries are added

### Data Portability

All data is stored in SQLite (default) or PostgreSQL database with full export capabilities.

---

## Updates & Maintenance

### Updating Docker Installation

```bash
docker pull whahn1983/pycashflow:latest
docker stop pycashflow
docker rm pycashflow
# Run the docker run command again with your volume mounts
```

### Updating Manual Installation

```bash
cd /path/to/pycashflow
git pull origin master
flask db upgrade
# Restart your WSGI server
```

### Database Migrations

PyCashFlow uses Flask-Migrate for database schema management:

- Migrations in `migrations/versions/` are source-controlled and are the only
  schema history used by deployments.
- Containers/startup scripts must **never** run `flask db init` or
  `flask db migrate` automatically.

- For model/schema changes during development:
  1. Update models.
  2. Run `flask db migrate -m "<description>"`.
  3. Review the generated migration file in `migrations/versions/`.
  4. Run `flask db upgrade`.
  5. Commit both model changes and migration file to Git.
